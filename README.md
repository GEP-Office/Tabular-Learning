| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| EXCELFORMER : A Neural Network Surpassing GBDTs on Tabular Data | Jan 2023 | 1.outperforms GBTD on 28 public datasets 2.intra-feature / inter-feature attention 3.MIXUP for tabular data |
| Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on typical tabular data? | Jul 2022 | 1. new dataset benchmark 2. accounts for hyperparameter cost 3. MLPs not good at irregular target function/uninformative features/non-rotationally invariant features |
